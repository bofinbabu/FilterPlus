**A simple realtime content filtering extention for Chrome.**
Content filtering in web browsers is a tedious process for most of the people because of several reasons. By blocking JavaScript, Cookies and Popups, end users can ensure maximum protection from browser based attacks and vulnerabilities. In order to accomplish this, we built an extension for Google Chrome which lets it’s users to have easy control on cookies, images, JavaScripts, popups and notifications. We also build this extension in such a way that it remembers the choice of options made by the user for every URLs, thereby letting user’s create rules for every websites they visit.

* The “Cookies” module has three options in the drop down menu, namely Allow, Session only and Block. The Allow and Block option enables and disables cookies for the current URL respectively. The session only option allows cookies to be set only for the particular session and will be removed when a new session starts. Disabling cookies will prevent sites from storing confidential user information in the host PC. 
* The “Images” module let’s user block images in the current URL, if they want. Web sites containing obscene images can be made safe for work(SFW) using this feature.
* The “JavaScript” module also has two option, either to enable or disable JavaScript in the current web page. Through this features user can be made sure that no JavaScript based attacks originates from the current web page
* The “Popups” module allows an option to block Popups in the current tab. Since most of the Adware’s make use of popups, disabling them will help the user from protecting the same.
* The “Notifications” has three options, either to allow, block or ask-and-allow notification on the desktop. Notification can be often annoying or often contains links to third party advertisements. This can be effectively disabled using this feature.
